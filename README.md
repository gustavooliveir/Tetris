# Tetris
A simple version of the Tetris game coded in Python

# Instalation
The only necessary library that is required to run this game other than the standard pyhton ones is the Pygame library. The game should run fine.

# Instructions
The game starts as soon as the code starts running. The gameplay works as follows:
LEFT KEY - moves the moving piece to the left
RIGHT KEY - moves the moving piece to the right
UP KEY - rotated the moving piece clockwise

# Improvements needed
The game runs pretty well, but some features might be improved, for instance: 

  1. The pieces might have diffenrt colors
  2. A feature for speeding up the piece falling down can be implemented
  3. The score box can be improved to look better
